# Milestone Project #1 - Portfolio
Portfolio example site I've created for the first milestone project
for Code Institute's User Centric Frontend Development module.

[This project on github pages](https://emilohlund-git.github.io/resume/.)

## UX
Essentially this website is for the person who owns it, to show off his / hers talent.
Also a platform to showcase previous projects / link to relevant websites / social media platforms.

The important UX aspect here is to have the proper information displayed very accessably.
(Which would be the showcased previous projects, a resum√© and a way to get a hold of the person)

The wireframe is in a .png file in this repository.

## Features
1. Fixed Navbar (With a constant hamburger icon)
* I believe it suits the fact of having a fixed navbar to hide the menu buttons behind a hamburger icon.
2. Hero Image with a Call To Action button
* It's an easy and fast way to display what this website is going to be about, and to provide a fast shortcut to the most essential part of the website.
3. Interactive images with modals
* Again to keep it minimalistic and be able to provide the information in a way where it doesn't crowd the website.
4. Bootstrap cards with the [fancybox](https://www.fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) plugin
* Following the minimalistic theme where I can showcase a lot of projects and not take up a whole lot of space. Also having it turn into a carousel in smaller width browser windows helps.
5. Contact form
* Great way to be able to get in touch as easy, and as fast as possible.
7. Footer with social media links
* Recognizable, fast way to showcase the platforms where you are active.

## Technologies Used
1. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
* Using Bootstrap for it's flexibility with responsive websites, and great component library.
2. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* For it's functionality with Bootstrap elements and it's easy ability of targeting and animating elements in HTML using Javascript.
3. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* The project includes Font Awesome for, well, icons.
4. [Fancy Box](https://www.fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)
* Great way to display galleries, super clean, responsive & easy to use.

## Testing
No real testing was done for this project, all elements are very straight forward.
